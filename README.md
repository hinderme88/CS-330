# How do I approach designing software?
I always approach designing software by first considering the request, or the need. Having a thorough understanding of what the software needs to accomplish is essential. Keeping the high-level design and requirements in mind throughout the process will also facilitate a highly polished finished product.
## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I was able to assemble a fully functional project with several different modularized classes. Separating out functions and keeping my main method as simple as possible meant preventing clutter and confusion from complicating the body of my project.
## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I began with the template code that was provided in the course. From there I customized this code and made it fit my needs and my vision for the project. I went with creating the functionality first, getting all of the classes established, before starting to build in the finer details.
## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think being able to get the core functionality in place, and having all interconnected functions and classes working smoothly, is a good start to any design approach. Also it never hurts to have well-working code to reference or glean ideas from, as long as proper credit is attributed.
# How do I approach developing programs?
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I made good use of header files for this project, and tried to implement a sensible organizational structure with my folders. This was of special importance for the sake of using relative file paths for things like textures - having a good folder structure that allowed easy reference of important files or images greatly simplified things.
## How did iteration factor into your development?
There was a lot of iteration involved in my coding this term. Making small changes and running the code often means you can narrow immediately in on what factor or change may have contributed to the outcomes on the screen. This really applies to most any coding project, and was especially useful in such a project where the learning curve was quite great and it wasn't always easy to pinpoint what was causing an issue.
## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I believe this term has helped me grow as a developer. I was given very helpful starter code and good resources for reading, but there also an expectation of self-reliance as I worked through the projects. I had to learn to manipulate the programs on my own, and try to understand in depth what was happening at every stage of execution, in order to make the changes necessary for the final project.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course has introduced me to a corner of software development unlike any I've previously explored. It's not necessarily something I would have pursued on my own, due to the great unfamiliarity of it. It really is a whole new experience. I find this invaluable, as it has helped to expand my mind and push me to explore more challenging topics and frameworks that I otherwise might have avoided.
